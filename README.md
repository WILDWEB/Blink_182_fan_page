# My First Project

## User centric front end development
-------------------------------------------
I built a static (front-end only) website for a band.
The band is a modern day pop/punk band called 'Blink182' The band was started in 90s performing live at numerous events around the world. After interviewing the bands representatives I was given the following requirements:
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
Photos of the band members
A video clip
Audio clips
Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
